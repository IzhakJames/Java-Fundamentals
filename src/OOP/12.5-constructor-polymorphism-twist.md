# 12.5 â€“ OOP Constructor Twist: Method Overriding Pitfall

## ðŸ§  Challenge Overview

This challenge explores a subtle (and dangerous!) behavior when a **parent constructor calls an overridable method**, and how that leads to **unexpected results** during object construction.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Scenario: Constructor Calls Overridden Method

```java
class Parent {
    Parent() {
        System.out.println("Parent constructor");
        display();
    }

    void display() {
        System.out.println("Parent display");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
int value = 42;

    Child() {
        System.out.println("Child constructor");
    }

    @Override
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Child display: " + value);
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child c = new Child();
    }
}
```
---

## ðŸ§¾ Output
```
Parent constructor
Child display: 0
Child constructor
```

---

## ðŸ¤¯ Why Is the Output Unexpected?

- When `new Child()` is executed:
    - First, the `Parent` constructor runs.
    - Inside the `Parent` constructor, `display()` is called.
- Since `display()` is **overridden in Child**, the `Child` version is invoked.
- But at this point:
    - `value` has **not yet been initialized** in `Child`.
    - Java assigns `0` as the default value for `int`.
- Only **after the parent constructor finishes**, the `Child` constructor runs and `value` becomes 42.

---

## ðŸ”¥ The Twist

This behavior is legal in Java but **very dangerous**.

You're calling a **polymorphic method** from a constructor â€” and that method executes code from a subclass that **isn't fully constructed yet**.

---

## ðŸš« Why You Should Avoid This

- Can lead to **null values**, **uninitialized state**, or **runtime errors**.
- Makes debugging extremely hard.
- Violates the principle of **constructor safety**.

---

## âœ… Best Practice

> Never call overridable (non-final) methods from constructors.

- Keep constructors simple and focused on field initialization.
- Defer any customizable behavior to an **`init()`** method called after construction (or use a builder pattern).

---

## ðŸ§  Summary

- Parent constructors run before child constructors.
- If a parent constructor calls an overridden method:
    - The child method runs with **partially constructed state**.
- Avoid calling instance methods (especially overridable ones) from constructors.
- This is a classic **OOP twist** that tests your deep understanding of inheritance and initialization.
